## Introduction
The mobile application provides a system to manage soccer leagues. Each player, team owner or league owner needs to create a profile, which includes a password that is encrypted by the system. The profile will have stored the user information, stats, teams, leagues and administrative permissions. The system is self-sustainable, each player requests permission to be added to the team, which is accepted/rejected by the team owner and in the same manner, each time a team wants to be created, it requests permission to a league to be added to it. Leagues are created by application admins. All the information (stats, schedule, team, players, data, etc) is stored in a database.
